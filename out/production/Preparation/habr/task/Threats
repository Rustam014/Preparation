There is two streams - producer and consumer. The manufacturer generates some data (numbers in the example). The producer “consumes” them.
The two threads share a common data buffer, the size of which is limited. If the buffer is empty, the consumer must wait for data to appear there.
If the buffer is completely full, the producer must wait until the consumer picks up the data and space becomes available.
